### Notes on Phase 1 Components

**Motor Compatibility:**
- A2212 1400kv is slightly underpowered for S800 V2 (frame recommends 2204-2205 2300kv)
- Will still fly, just not as fast
- Acceptable for initial testing

**Battery Options:**
- 2200mAh: Lighter, better handling, ~12-15 min flight time
- 3000mAh: Heavier, longer flight time ~18-20 min
- Recommend starting with 2200mAh for initial flights

**Propeller Sizing:**
- S800 V2 specs say max 6045
- A2212 can handle 8060 or 9045
- Start with 8060 for safety margin
